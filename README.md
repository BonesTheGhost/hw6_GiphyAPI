This website was one of the homework assignments for my Vanderbilt University Full-Stack Bootcamp. The purpose was to introduce us to the concept of API's (specifically the Giphy API in this instance) where we would use AJAX and JSON to retrieve the necessary GIF's, and then display those on a web page in a certain format.

In addition to retrieving and siplaying GIF's, we were also instructed to build in the funcitonality for searching for topics and pulling those search results with the API. 

Play/Pause was also a required feature, and this can be achieved by simply clocking on the GIF's themselves. This was done through some clever manipulation of the JSON data (essentially replacing the static images with the actual GIF upon clicking, and then toggling this feature with each click).
